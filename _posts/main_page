I have been taking courses through Susquahanna Valley's Computer Coding and
Programming course.  Through it I have made many interpretive files and a 
few responsive programs.

<h2>Some Things I have made through python are:</h2><br>
<ul>
  <li>The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.</li>
  <li>Moving Lines</li>
  <li>Input controlled item collection game</li>
  
</ul>
