-You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
-
-To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
-
-Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
-
-{% highlight ruby %}
-def print_hi(name)
-  puts "Hi, #{name}"
-end
-print_hi('Tom')
-#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
-{% endhighlight %}
