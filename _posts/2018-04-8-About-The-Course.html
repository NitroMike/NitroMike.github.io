    <p id="Turtle"> When we began the class we were told the plans for the course and the general idea of what we would be learning.
      Our teacher told us that before we started to learn Python, we would learn an introductory language first.  The language we started
      with was Turtle.  Turtle is a drawing language with pretty simple commands and styles.  If you would like to look into Turtle as a
      starting language or out of interest you can find it <a href="https://turtleacademy.com/">here</a>.
